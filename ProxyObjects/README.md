In the example we initilized a proxy class/object via di.xml which replace the original class SlowLoading.
Through proxy class which is a lazy load version of slowLoading class, the slowLoading class will only be injected when we need it (i.e. when we call any method within the SlowLoading class),
otherwise it will never be called, no matters if it's automatically injected via constructor.
