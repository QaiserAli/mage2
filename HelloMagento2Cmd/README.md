###  Simple HelloMagento2Cmd module

In this module we are going to create our own custom command with name 'mage2-hello-magento2'. The command will appear in the list with all other magento 2 commands.
The 'mage2-hello-magento2' command will not do anything special and it just shows the text 'Hello to Magento2 Cmd' on terminal.
